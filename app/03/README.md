## 3. Check words with typos:

There are three types of typos that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to
check if they are one typo (or zero typos) away.

    Examples:
    pale, ple 足> true
    pales, pale 足> true
    pale, bale 足> true
    pale, bake 足> false
