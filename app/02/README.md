## 2. Check words with jumbled letters :


Our brain can read texts even if letters are jumbled, like the following sentence: “Yuo
cna porbalby raed tihs esaliy desptie teh msispeillgns.” Given two strings, write a
method to decide if one is a partial­permutation of the other. Consider a
partial­permutation only if:
­ The first letter hasn’t changed place
 If word has more than 3 letters, up to 2/3 of the letters have changed place

    Examples:
    you, yuo ­> true
    probably, porbalby ­> true
    despite, desptie ­> true
    moon, nmoo ­> false
    misspellings, mpeissngslli ­> false
